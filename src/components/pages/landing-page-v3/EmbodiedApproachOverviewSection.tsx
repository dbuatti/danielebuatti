            I help performers and communicators connect body, breath, and voice so they can express themselves with freedom, authenticity, and ease. My work is about discovering a voice that feels grounded, resonant, and spacious â€” one that grows out of the whole body rather than being forced or strained.

            With over 12 years of experience as a Music Director, Pianist, Arranger, Vocal Coach, and Educator, I bring together professional music theatre expertise, vocal pedagogy, and somatic practices influenced by kinesiology and yoga. This integrated approach forms the foundation for my unique, embodied coaching.
